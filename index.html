  <p>The shop contained practical joke objects, such as <b>Extendable Ears, a Reusable Hangman, Skiving Snackboxes</b>, and Fred and George's special WonderWitch products,
    such as; <b>Love Potions, Ten-Second Pimple Vanishers, and Pygmy Puffs</b>. There is also a section of Muggle Magic Tricks, which are said to do steady business,
    despite not being big sellers. The shop also sells a number of defensive magical objects. This establishment started out as an <em>'owl-post service'</em> led by
    the twins from the Burrow, and later continued from Hogwarts, selling joke-products until the store front was opened.
